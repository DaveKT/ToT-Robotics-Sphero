##Going The Distance

This code demonstrates driving Sphero (or Ollie) using the Roll Action and requires little programming skill. The goal of the program is to teach the student *distance = time x speed* through a simple game.

###Behavior

When executed the robot will drive forward for a predetermined time and speed.

###The Game

Place two lines on the floor (using tape) separated by some distance (e.g. five feet). Challenge the students to have the robot start on one line and stop on the other. They may adjust the speed and time parameters of the Roll Action. For this exercise, the heading should remain at zero.

**N.B. Remind the students to aim the robot prior to executing the program!**

###The Key Lesson
Make sure the students observe that the faster they go the less time they need to get to the goal and vice-versa. Also, point out that even with precise coding (exact numbers) there will be some variability (the robot may stop slightly short or overshoot a tad). Finally, discuss the concept of precision and control and point at that at slower speeds both attributes improve.
