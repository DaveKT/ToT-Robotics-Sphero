## Square Dance

This program demonstrates the motor control through the application of loops.

### Behavior

This program drives the Ollie or Sphero Robot in a square. The robot will shine a green light (LED) during runtime and turn red once finished executing the square.

### Key Lesson

The square is a four sided shape comprise of 4 90° angles. By using simple addition, we can iterate though the four headings needed to face the robot 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. Understanding the concepts of heading and angle are important to master prior to solving the maze, this session's final challenge, as this is we control the robot's direction.
