## Figure Eight
This applications extends the students' knowledge of circle geometry. The figure eight is essentially two circles traced out back to back. The negative values in the program (i.e. -360Ëš) causes Sphero / Ollie to trace out a circle counter clockwise where positive values result in clockwise traces.

### Behavior
The Ollie or Sphero will first trace out a circle clockwise, return to it's origin, and then trace out a circle following a counter clockwise path resulting in a figure eight.
