## Taste of Technology Sphero Robotics Class Outline

ToT Sphero Robotics is a four day course taught over the period of 4 weeks to students between the ages of 9 and 12. The primary goal of the course is to introduce technical concepts to students who show an interest and who may not have had prior exposure.

### Course Materials for ToT Robotics

*	[Sphero or Ollie Robots](http://store.sphero.com)
* 	[SPRK Lightening Lab Software](http://www.sphero.com/education)
*	[Compatible iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch](https://sphero.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211154)
*	Sphero SPRK Lightening Lab Code Included in this Repository

### Course Outline

#### Week One
**Goals**: Introduce the SPRK Software, Introduce Loops, Introduce Motor Control, Introduce IF THEN ELSE

**Programs**

All example program files are in the [ToT_Robotics_Sphero](https://github.com/DaveKT/ToT-Robotics-Sphero/tree/master/docs/Examples) repository on GitHub.

1.	[ColorMe](docs/Examples/ColorMe.md)
2.	[LightShow](docs/Examples/LightShow.md)
3.	[GoingTheDistance](docs/Examples/GoingTheDistance.md)
4.	[Degrees](docs/Examples/Degrees.md)

**Session Guide**

1.	Show the students the Ollie and Sphero Robots. If the class is calm demonstrate how the Ollie and Sphero and move when on the floor using the simple remote software for each.
2.	Show the students the SPRK Lightning Lab Software. Be sure to highlight how to start a new program, the tabs with the different kind of command blocks, how to add a block to a program, how to edit a block's parameters, and how to delete a block from a program.
3.	Have the students copy the [ColorMe](docs/Examples/ColorMe.md) program. Tell them to set the color to red. After they run that program tell them to set the color to whatever color they'd like.
4.	Discuss the concept of loops. There is more information about loops in the [LightShow markdown file](docs/Examples/LightShow.md).
5.	Have the students copy the LightShow program and review the lesson listed in the LightShow markdown files once the assignment is completed.
6.	Review the concepts listed in the [GoingTheDistance markdown file](docs/Examples/GoingTheDistance.md).
7.	Ask the students to play the Going the Distance game outline in the GoingTheDistance markdown file.

**Stretch**

1.	Review the basic geometry of a circle including 360° reference. Discuss the concept of heading 0° is facing straight ahead, 90° is right, 180° is facing back, -90° or 180° is facing left. *Note in Spheroland they use the negative values.*
2.	Discuss the concept of pitch, roll, and yaw. There is a very good explanation if you need to review on the [Smithsonian's How Things Fly](http://howthingsfly.si.edu/flight-dynamics/roll-pitch-and-yaw) site. Suggestion, when reviewing this concept with students hold up the robot and rotate it around the various axes. Do not share the web page since we're not discussing flight, just the axis of rotation.
3.	Discuss IF, THEN, ELSE statements. There is more information about this statement in the [Degrees](docs/Examples/Degrees.md) markdown file.
4.	Have the students code the [Degrees](docs/Examples/Degrees.PNG) program in the SPRK Lightning Lab.

#### Week Two
**Goals**: Introduce additional sensors and readings, control the Sphero or Ollie using motors.

**Programs**

All example program files are in the [ToT_Robotics_Sphero](docs/Examples) repository on GitHub.

1.	[SquareDance](docs/examples/SquareDance.md)
2.	[ObstacleManagement](docs/examples/ObstacleManagement.md)

**Session Guide**

1. Review the degrees in a circle and how they relate to the Sphero. For reference you may wish to display or hand out the [Ollie Degrees diagram](https://github.com/DaveKT/ToT_Robotics_Sphero/blob/master/Ollie%20Degrees.png). Important note about the reference. Spheros operated in a fixed coordinate system. This means that, once aligned, each degree in the circle represents a fixed direction from the point of view of the operator or programmer, not Ollie. 0˚ is always directly away from the operator. 90˚ is always to the operator's right, etc.
2. Ask the students what steps are required to make a robot navigate in the shape of a square. The response should include something along the lines of move forward (0˚) for some period of time, turn left (270˚)…

**Stretch**

#### Week Three
**Goals**: Solve navigational problems that require the student to apply what they have learned about absolute position within a 360˚ reference.

**Programs**

All example program files are in the [ToT_Robotics_Sphero](docs/Examples) repository on GitHub.

1.	Figure Eight
2.	Cones

**Session Guide**

1.	Conduct a very brief review of the geometry of a circle,
    * 0˚ is straight ahead
    * 90˚ is right
    * 180˚ is back
    * 270˚ is left
2.	Introduce the concept of the arc.
3. Have the students copy and run the Figure Eight program. Note that the spin blocks in this program are set to 360˚, full circles.
4. Have a brief discussion about the number of degrees in a half circle and full circle. (Review ahead of time, but do not share with the students, the Cone program.)
5.	Set out four or five "Cones" and challenge the students to write a program similar to the Figure Eight program that will navigate the cones.

**Stretch**

1.	Assuming the students were able to navigate through the cones, challenge the students to extend the program to turn the robot around and come back.

#### Week Four
**Goals**: Using the information presented during this session, program an Ollie to navigate a maze.

**Programs & Materials**

1.	Sample Program (This is not the application the students will write as the maze you choose to layout may be different than the once presented in this session. This is provided as an example only.)
2.	Maze Construction - Can be anything that will lay out the outline of a maze (e.g. pool noodles, painter's tape, wooden blocks, etc).
